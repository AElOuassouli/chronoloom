# Unreleased

## Added

- Initial standalone crate, extracted from the combined `timewarp` crate that
  previously served as both the Rust logic and its PyO3 binding.
- `algebra::intersection` for half-open intervals, with doc tests.
- Release automation: a `chronoloom-v*` tag publishes to crates.io via Trusted
  Publishing (OIDC, no stored token) after a manual approval, and cuts a GitHub
  Release from this changelog. The tag is rejected unless its commit is on
  `main`, its version matches `Cargo.toml`, and this file documents it.
