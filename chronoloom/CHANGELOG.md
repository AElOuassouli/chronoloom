# Unreleased

## Added

- Initial standalone crate, extracted from the combined `timewarp` crate that
  previously served as both the Rust logic and its PyO3 binding.
- `algebra::intersection` for half-open intervals, with doc tests.
- `make release-fix` / `release-minor` / `release-major` (and
  `make chronoloom-release-*` from the repo root) bump the version, date the
  changelog, refresh `Cargo.lock`, then commit and tag. Nothing is pushed.
- Release automation: a `chronoloom-v*` tag publishes to crates.io via Trusted
  Publishing (OIDC, no stored token) after a manual approval, and cuts a GitHub
  Release from this changelog. The tag is rejected unless its commit is on
  `main`, its version matches `Cargo.toml`, and this file documents it.
